🧠 C++ Decision-Making Statements

📌 Aim

To study and implement decision-making constructs in C++ through simple, real-world programs such as:

Finding the largest among three numbers

Checking if a number is even or odd

Identifying vowels or consonants

Displaying the name of the weekday using a switch-case

📚 Theory
Decision-making in C++ involves using conditional statements to control the flow of execution based on logical conditions. These statements allow programs to behave dynamically depending on inputs or computed values.

Key decision-making constructs in C++ include:

🔹 if
🔹 if...else
🔹 else if
🔹 switch

These tools are foundational in developing responsive and interactive programs.

🧑‍💻 Programs Implemented
🔸 Largest of Three Numbers
Compares three inputs and determines the largest using if...else.

🔸 Even or Odd
Checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulo operator and conditional logic.

🔸 Vowel or Consonant
Determines if the input character is a vowel or consonant using if...else.

🔸 Weekday Name (Switch Case)
Displays the name of the weekday corresponding to a number (1–7) using the switch statement.

✅ Conclusion
Through these programs, I gained hands-on experience in using decision-making statements in C++. This experiment helped me understand how to control program flow, respond to user inputs, and implement logical branching effectively.
