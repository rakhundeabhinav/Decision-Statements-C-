C++ Decision Making Statements

📌 Aim

To study and implement decision making statements in C++ through basic programs such as:


Finding the largest of three numbers

Checking whether a number is even or odd

Identifying vowels or consonants

Displaying weekday name using switch case

📚 Theory
Decision making in C++ is performed using conditional statements, which help control the flow of the program based on logical conditions.

Common decision making statements in C++:
if

if...else

else if

switch

These are essential for building programs that react dynamically based on user input or internal logic.

🧑‍💻 Programs
1. Largest of Three Numbers
Description: Takes three inputs and finds the largest using if...else statements.

2. Even or Odd
Description: Checks if a number is even or odd using % operator and if...else.

3. Vowel or Consonant
Description: Checks whether an entered character is a vowel or consonant using if...else.

4. Weekday Name using Switch Case
Description: Takes a number (1–7) and displays the corresponding weekday using switch.

✅ Conclusion
By implementing these programs, I learned how to use decision making statements in C++ and gained valuable practical knowledge in controlling program flow.
